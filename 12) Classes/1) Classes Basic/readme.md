# *What are Classes?*
### Classes in JavaScript are a blueprint for creating objects with shared properties and methods. They are syntactical sugar over JavaScript's existing prototype-based inheritance. They make defining and creating objects easier and more straightforward.

# **Key Components**
### Constructor: A special method for creating and initializing objects created with a class.

### Methods: Functions that provide behavior to the class objects.

### Inheritance: Classes can extend other classes, inheriting their properties and methods.
